While you were performing the last memory task, your mind may

have wondered off at times. You will now have to reflect on the

thoughts you were having during the previous task. At each trial,

you will beasked to rate the content of your thoughts on a scale

To move the marker left: press '2'
To move the marker right: press '4'

Once you are satisfied with the placement of the marker, simply

wait forthe next trial to appear.


Press any key to continue...
