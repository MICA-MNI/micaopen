Files here contain sample PowerPoint presentations used to create the
instructional videos for the MST, sample videos, and scripts we have used.
The video instrucions are extremely helpful in letting participants know
what exactly you want them to do with the similar lure items.  WE HIGHLY
RECOMMEND USING VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS.
