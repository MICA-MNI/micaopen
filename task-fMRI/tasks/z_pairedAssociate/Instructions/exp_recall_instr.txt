The first part of the experiment is over.

During this second part, your memory for the word pairs will now be tested.

You will be presented with one word from each pair on the left side of the screen.
Try to use this word as a cue to recall the other word from the pair and type it into the space provided. Press return when you have typed in your answer.

Please be as accurate as you can as the words MUST be spelled correctly. If you make a mistake, you can use the backspace button to correct it before hitting return.
You will have 10 seconds to make each response. You will be informed of the correct word if you are incorrect.

Depending on your performance, you may need to do this test again, so it is important to try to relearn anything you get wrong. 

Press RETURN to start the task.
