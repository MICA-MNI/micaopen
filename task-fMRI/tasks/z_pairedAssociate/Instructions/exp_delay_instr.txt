Welcome Back!

Your memory for the word pairs will now be tested.

You will be presented with one word from each pair on the left side of the screen.
Try to use this word as a cue to recall the other word from the pair and type it into the space provided. Press return when you have typed in your answer.
Please be as accurate as you can as the words MUST be spelled correctly. If you make a mistake, you can use the backspace button to correct it before hitting return.

You will have 10 seconds to make each response. 
You will not receive any feedback. 

After each answer you will be also asked to indicate how confident you are about your response using a rating scale between 1 (not at all confident) to 7 (extremely confident).

Press RETURN to start the task.
