Welcome to this experiment!

In this task you will be presented with a number of word pairs.

Please try to learn these word pairs to the best of your ability as you will be tested on them at a later stage.

To help you remember the pairs, please try to think of associations between the words themselves. For instance, if the word pair was 'tiger-shoe' you might try to picture in your mind a tiger wearing a shoe.
