In this experiment, your memory of the paired items that were previously shown to you will be tested.

At each trial, one image will be shown at the top of the screen and three others will be displayed
underneath it.

Using the button box, your task is to select which of these three images (1, 2, or 3) was initially
paired up with the image at the top of the screen.

You have a very limited time to answer, so make your choice as quickly and as accurately as possible.
