# From histology to macroscale function in the human amygdala

This repository provides notebooks to follow the workflow for analysis of microstructure and functional connectivity of the human amygdala (see Reference below). The three main steps for this study are divided into each of the three following folders and should be followed in this order, according to the analysis steps in our manuscript:
1. Histology
2. Structure
3. Function

## Open data and software

The present study was made possible by multiple open datasets, listed below: 
- BigBrain: Post mortem histological data (Amunts et al., 2013)
- Curated segmentation of subcortical structures for BigBrain (Xiao et al., 2019)
- Probabilistic atlas of amygdala subdivisions (Amunts et al., 2005; Amunts et al., 2020)
- MICA-PNI: In vivo, ultra high field imaging data (Cabalo et al., 2024)

We also leverage several open software packages notably: 
- PyRadiomics: https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/
- UMAP: https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/ 
- BigBrainWarp (Paquola et al., 2021)
- BrainStat (Larivi√®re, Bayrak, Vos de Wael, et al., 2023)
- BrainSpace (Vos de Wael, Benkarim et al., 2020)
