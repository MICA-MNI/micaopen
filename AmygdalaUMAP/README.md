# FROM HISTOLOGY TO MACROSCALE FUNCTION IN THE HUMAN AMYGDALA 

The following data demonstrates the workflow and different processes for analysis of the human amygdala. From studying it's histology and MRI microstructure to functional network dynamics. The three main steps for this multimodal study are divided into each of the three following folders in the respective order:

1. Histology
2. Structure
3. Function
