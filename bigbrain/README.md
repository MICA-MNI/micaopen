# Big Brain Meta-data

The MICA labs repo for all things Big Brain

## This repository currently contains

Intensity profiles (parcels x s, where s represents a equivolumetric surface)   
Statistical moments (parcels x m, where m represents the moments: mean, std, skewness and kurtosis)  
Microstructure profile covariance (MPC) matrices (parcels x parcels, in the same order as profiles)

Profiles and moments are available with and without regression for the midsurface y-coordinate. The BigBrain exhibits a strong anterior-posterior gradient in intensity values that is likely partially due to the coronal slicing and reconstruction, and partly to do with variations in cortical architecture. 

### Two types of surface construction

The profiles were generated by sampling Big Brain intensities along equivolumetric surfaces at 163,842 matched vertices per hemisphere.

The purely equivolumetric approach utilises the original gray and white matter surfaces released with BigBrain. We generated 18 equivolumetric surfaces in between these, and removed the most upper and lower to mitigate the influence of partial volume effects. 

The laminar-based approach involved the construction of six equivolumetric surfaces between layer 1 and layer 4, and layer 4 and white matter. Thus the eighth surface is layer 4.  The layer 1/2 boundary and layer 4 peak rely on an automateed layer detection algorithm (Wagstyl, 2018), which performs well in eulaminate cortex but is not validated for use in dysgranular and agranular cortex.
