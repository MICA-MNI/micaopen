main_analysis: Code for the main analysis in the manuscript.

build_gh: Code for generating gradient profiles and inter-areal dissimilarity.

build_lh: Code for generating gradient profiles and intra-areal dissimilarity.

demo_build_gradients: a demo code for showing how to generate vertex-wise gradients used in the main analysis, including MPC, SC, and FC gradients. All gradients were estimated based on vertex-wise  MPC, SC, and FC matrices, which are available at the OSF platform (https://osf.io/mhq3f/). Please download them to run this demo code.
