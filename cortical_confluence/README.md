The mesiotemporal lobe (MTL) is implicated in many cognitive processes, is compromised in numerous brain disorders, and exhibits a unique cytoarchitectural transition from six-layered parahippocampal isocortex to three-layered hippocampal allocortex. Leveraging an ultra-high-resolution histological reconstruction of a human brain, our study showed that the dominant axis of MTL cytoarchitectural differentiation follows the iso-to-allocortical transition and depth-specific variations in neuronal density. Projecting the histology-derived MTL model to in-vivo functional MRI, we furthermore determined how its cytoarchitecture underpins its intrinsic effective connectivity and association to large-scale networks. Here, the cytoarchitectural gradient was found to underpin intrinsic effective connectivity of the MTL, but patterns differed along the anterior-posterior axis. Moreover, while the iso-to-allocortical gradient parametrically represented the multiple-demand relative to task-negative networks, anterior-posterior gradients represented transmodal versus unimodal networks. Our findings establish that the combination of micro- and macrostructural features allow the MTL to represent dominant motifs of whole-brain functional organization.

### Overview

The confluence of iso- and allo-cortex in the mesiotemporal lobe exhibits a profound cytoarchitectural gradient, and intersects with an anterior-posterior axis to harbour multiple dominant functional motifs within the parahippocampus-hippocampus complex. In the present project, we explored the cytoarchtiectural and functional correlates of the iso-to-allocortical and anterior-posterior axes of the mesiotemporal lobe. Here, we would like to share our scripts and maps to allow furher exploration of these axes. If you use the containing material please read and cite the following manuscript: <br />
