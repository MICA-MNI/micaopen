# Microstructure profile covariance (MPC) analysis
Welcome to the MPC package; a companion to our article "Microstructural and functional gradients are increasingly dissociated in transmodal cortices". Here, we present the three step procedure to construct individualised microstructure profile covariance networks.

## Update! BigBrainWarp
We've expanded the contents of this repository to a new toolbox - we recommend turning your attention to BigBrainWarp for all the most up to date developments, as well as a suite of new tools to help perform integrative BigBrain-MRI analyes. -> https://bigbrainwarp.readthedocs.io/

## Software dependencies
Freesurfer (tested with 5.1 - https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/)   
FSL (tested with 5.0 - https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki)   
Python (tested with 2.7 and 3.6)   
MATLAB (tested on 17b and 16a - https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)   
SurfStat (http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/surfstat/)   
surface_tools (https://github.com/kwagstyl/surface_tools)   

## Preprocessing
Prior to using this package it is expected that the individual scans have undergone recon-all processing with freesurfer, and a myelin-sensitive image has been constructed (ie: t1w/t2w, qt1, mt)

## File and folder structure
Our pipeline assumes a BIDS folder structure (http://bids.neuroimaging.io/)
Note: the output of recon-all is housed within the surfaces subfolder.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# /Data/BIDS/   
#       .../subID/   
#             .../anat/  
#             .../func/  
#             .../dwi/

#                           .../surf/   
#                           .../tmp/   
#                           .../touch/   
#                           .../trash/   
#                   ...   
```   

## Step by step guide
Within the github repository are three scripts, which should be run in sequence. There are a few lines to hardcode in each script such as the path to your BIDS directory and subject list. These will be contained in the first few lines. The first two scripts operate through bash, while the third is operationalised within matlab. 

**01_constructSurfaces.sh**: Constructs equivolumetric intracortical surfaces using "surface tools" (https://github.com/kwagstyl/surface_tools)

**02_myelinMaptoSurf.sh**: Compiles intensity values along intracortical surfaces from a myelin-sensitive volume, and registers an annotation from fsaverage to the individual subject.

**03_surfToMPC.m**: Imports data to matlab and builds microstructure profile covariance matrices. Set up to be used with the 1012 parcellation scheme. An additional step of normalisation to a standard template is necessary for vertex-wise analyses.

Principle gradient from the manuscript (G1-HIST and G1-MRI). G1_hist is derived from Big Brain (Figure 2) and was mapped to fsaverage5 and conte69 using nearest neighbour interpolation (improved methods for registration of Big Brain to these surfaces is upcoming and should be adopted in the future). G1_mri is derived from T1w/T2w imaging from the Human Connectome Project (Figure 3).
