## Hello! You've landed on an old directory.
We've expanded the contents of this repository into an entire toolbox, called "BigBrainWarp" ðŸŽ‰. It contains a whole suite of tools and resources to help perform microstructural and integrative BigBrain-MRI analyes. So, what are you still doing here? Go to https://bigbrainwarp.readthedocs.io/

If that doesn't fulfill all your microstructural desires, then maybe you need in vivo imaging data and pipelines. In that case see the MICs dataset (https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/mica-mics) and the mica-pipe (https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micapipe).

For any other questions, get in touch via casey (dot) paquola (at) gmail (dot) com
